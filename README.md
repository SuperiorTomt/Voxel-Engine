# Voxel Engine

## Objectives
- For this project, I’ll be developing a voxel engine with various features for generating and editing voxel-based objects. The main feature will be a system to procedurally generate a voxel landscape according to given specifications. The user will be able to adjust values like size of the world and height of mountains.
- Over the course of my capstone project, I've been mostly focusing on backend and graphics programming, so a project like this one will give me the opportunity to focus on an interesting element of graphics programming and also create a system I can show off visually.

## Tools
- I will be using Unity to develop this engine, placing a special emphasis on performance by combining faces wherever possible and not generating hidden faces.
- I chose Unity mostly due to my own familiarity, and because its robust tools for creating and rendering meshes will help me focus on the more fundamental elements of the project.

## Scope
- If I need to adjust my scope later on, I could easily cut a smaller feature, or add more features to the simulation like dynamic collision or different “types” of voxels that won’t combine their faces and are textured differently.

## Deliverables
- My final deliverable will be a playable demo of the tool, alongside a short video demonstration of its functionality.
